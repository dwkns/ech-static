Spend your day on spectacular walks through the moors and valleys or enjoy hugely varied terrain on horse back or by mountain bike. These are just some of the fantastic ways to see the outstanding beauty of the Exmoor countryside as well as the beautiful and varied wild life, including the unique Exmoor ponies and majestic Red Deer. If you prefer a more sedate day out, there are several impressive National Trust properties that you can visit nearby; as well as beautiful gardens including Hestercombe, Rosemoor and Marwood. ",
                  "mainText2": "These offer a lovely day out with beautiful woodlands, ornamental gardens and vivid floral landscapes to enjoy. There are also several teahouses to indulge in a traditional English afternoon tea. After a day of exploring Exmoor, you can look up towards the night sky for even more outstanding sights. Low light pollution and frequent clear skies mean there are often perfect conditions for a spot of stargazing. Exmoor National Park is designated as a Dark Sky Reserve, and is only one of two internationally."
