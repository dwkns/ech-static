          <p class="pt-12 lg:pr-32 px-4 lg:pl-0">Room 1 is a generously sized en-suite room looking out over the beautiful garden. You’ll stay in a king size bed with high quality bedding guaranteeing a great nights sleep.</p>
  
          <p class="pt-8 lg:pr-32 px-4 lg:pl-0">There is very comfortable leather sofa in the room, where you can relax with a hot drink made using our Tea and Nespresso coffee making facilities. It’s also a great place to enjoy watching our wall mounted LCD TV, with Freeview channels available. The bay window means that the room floods with light, with duck egg blue décor contributing to the airy calming feel.</p>
  
          <p class="pt-8 lg:pr-32 px-4 lg:pl-0">The room is also large enough to accommodate a family with either the sofa converting into a bed or there is room to accomodate a travel cot, which we can supply on request. The large en-suite has a heated towel radiator with large fluffy towels and indulgent natural bath products made locally. The traditional cast iron bath is perfect for soaking in after a day out on Exmoor.</p>
